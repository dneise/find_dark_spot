# find_dark_spot
A script that finds the darkest position near zenith for a given time and date. And for fun a Script that plots the whole sky.

## installation:

The cartopy builds inside anaconda are currently outdated
I created an issue for updating it.

In the mean time, install the dependencies like this:

```{shell}
conda install geos
conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/osgeo proj4
```

And then install cartopy with pip:

```{shell}
pip install cartopy
```
